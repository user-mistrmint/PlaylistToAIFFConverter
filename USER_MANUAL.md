1. Verify the file format is supported (XML, M3U, M3U8, TXT)
2. Check that the file isn't corrupted by opening it in a text editor
3. Ensure you have read permissions for the file
4. Try exporting the playlist again from iTunes/Music app

**Problem: Many Files Not Found**

3. Use the manual file location feature for a few files to help the app learn
4. Verify that the playlist file paths are correct

**Problem: Conversion Fails**

*Symptoms:* Files are found but conversion fails with errors

*Solutions:*
1. Check available disk space in the output directory
2. Verify that source files aren't corrupted or DRM-protected
3. Try converting a single file to isolate the issue
4. Reduce the number of concurrent operations
5. Check that you have write permissions to the output directory

**Problem: Poor Performance**

*Symptoms:* Conversion is very slow or system becomes unresponsive

*Solutions:*
1. Reduce the number of concurrent operations in settings
2. Close other applications to free up system resources
3. Choose a lower quality setting for faster conversion
4. Process smaller batches of files
5. Ensure adequate free RAM and disk space

**Problem: Audio Quality Issues**

*Solutions:*
1. Use "High" or "Maximum" quality settings
2. Verify that source files are high quality
3. Check that AIFF format settings match your requirements
4. Compare file sizes to ensure conversion completed properly

### Error Messages Explained

**"File not found at specified location"**
- The playlist references a file that doesn't exist at the given path
- Use file location features or manually locate the file

**"Unsupported audio format"**
- The source file format isn't supported for conversion
- Check the list of supported input formats in the documentation

**"Conversion failed: insufficient disk space"**
- Not enough free space in the output directory
- Free up disk space or choose a different output location

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What's the difference between AIFF and WAV formats?**
A: Both are uncompressed audio formats. AIFF uses big-endian byte order and is preferred by Traktor Pro 4, while WAV uses little-endian and has broader compatibility with other software.

**Q: Will converting to AIFF improve audio quality?**
A: Converting from lossy formats (like MP3) to AIFF won't improve quality, but it provides a consistent, uncompressed format that's optimal for DJ software performance.

**Q: How much disk space will I need?**
A: AIFF files are typically 3-4 times larger than 320kbps MP3 files. A 4-minute MP3 (about 10MB) becomes roughly 40MB as AIFF.

**Q: Can I convert protected/DRM files?**
A: No, the application cannot convert DRM-protected files. You'll need to use DRM-free versions of your music.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does file location sometimes fail?**
A: File paths in playlists can become outdated when files are moved, renamed, or when switching between different computers or user accounts.

**Q: Can I customize the AIFF format settings?**
A: The application uses Traktor Pro 4 optimized settings (44.1kHz, 16-bit, stereo) by default, which provides the best compatibility and performance.

**Q: What happens to metadata during conversion?**
A: The application preserves important metadata like track name, artist, album, and BPM information that's useful for DJ software.

**Q: Can I pause and resume conversions?**
A: You can cancel conversions and restart them later. The application will skip files that have already been successfully converted.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: How do I get my playlists from iTunes/Music app?**
A: Use File > Library > Export Playlist in iTunes/Music app and choose XML format for best compatibility.

**Q: Can I convert multiple playlists at once?**
A: Currently, the application processes one playlist at a time, but you can quickly switch between playlists and the app remembers your settings.

**Q: How do I import converted files into Traktor Pro 4?**
A: In Traktor, go to File > Import Music Folders and select your output directory. Traktor will analyze and import the AIFF files.

**Q: What if I have a very large playlist?**
A: The application handles large playlists efficiently, but you may want to process them in smaller batches for easier management and faster troubleshooting if issues arise.
